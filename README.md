This was the final Project of Team Electric Muffin, for ECEN 2440 "Applications of Embedded Systems", taught by Prof. Arielle Blum in Fall '24 at CU Boulder

In both in-class tournaments, this was the winning Bot.

In addition to the SumoBot and it's controller, we had three major extensions.
Distance Sensor - We incorporated a ultrasonic distance sensor to the rear of the bot. This allowed for a defensive automatic rotation when a competitor was beind the bot
NeoPixels - Two sets of NeoPixels, a row on the front of the bot, and a jewel on the top, allowed for a colorful display that made the competitions more exciting
SLAM IR Protocal - To reduce the impact of IR communications conflicts, we wrote a compressed IR Protocal
