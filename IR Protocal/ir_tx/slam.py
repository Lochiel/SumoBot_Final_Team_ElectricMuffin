# SumoBot Little Asynchronous Messaging - SLAM 
# Encoder for IR transmission of SumoBots
# Written by Cam Chalmers
# For ECEN 2440 - Applications of Embedded Systems, Spring '24
# Modified NEC code
# Based on code by Peter Hinch

#DONE Reduce data and address size from 8 to 4 bits
#TODO Reduce burst length
#TODO Reduce long/short space ratio
#TODO Make burst time based on tx frequency, so that higher frequencies reduce tx time
#TODO Reduce Start block size 
#TODO Evaluate possibility of a second, delayed transmission. This is to give a 2nd chance at capturing a corrupted transmission
