# SumoBot Little Asynchronous Messaging - SLAM 
# Encoder for IR transmission of SumoBots
# Written by Cam Chalmers
# For ECEN 2440 - Applications of Embedded Systems, Spring '24
# Modified NEC code
# Based on code by Peter Hinch

#DONE Reduce data and address size from 8 to 4 bits
#DONE Reduce burst length - Need Real world testing
#DONE Reduce long/short space ratio - Code changes implemented, ready to deploy
#DONE Make burst time based on tx frequency, so that higher frequencies reduce tx time
#DONE Reduce Start block size 
# First and second burst are both one DASH in length. A properly coded transmission will not have any other sequential DASH'es
#TODO Evaluate possibility of a second, delayed transmission. This is to give a 2nd chance at capturing a corrupted transmission

    #DONE change asize argument passed to super().__init__() to new size

    # 2 on/off times per bit. 
    # NEC asize is 68 for 32 bits of data + start and end blocks

    # 4*4 + 2 = 18 bits
